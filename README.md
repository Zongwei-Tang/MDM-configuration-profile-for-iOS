# MDM-configuration-profile-for-iOS
It is a mdm profile for iOS. Simply install that and you can ensure the device is only used for learning purpose. 

How to use: 
Use the Apple device you want to manage and go to the website: https://jlhs.jamfcloud.com/enroll/?, for username and passcode enter "enroll" for both of those two. Then the profile will be automatically downloaded, then install the profile, your apple device will then be restricted. 

Just for fun this is the MDM profile at my schoolðŸ˜‚
